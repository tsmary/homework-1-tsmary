What's the difference between repository and branch in git? A repository is your whole project(directories and files) that you clone on your computer. A branch is a version of you repository , or in other words, an independent line of development. 
What's the staging environment and how does it relate to a commit? A staging step in git allows you to continue making changes to the working directory, and when you decide you wanna interact with version control, it allows you to record changes in small commits.
